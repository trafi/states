## Why should I use states?

We're using states in Trafi for a few reasons:
- States help us share solutions between platforms
- States break down big problems to small pieces
- States keep our code pure and easily testable

## What is a state?

State is the crucial part of describing screen's logic in Trafi. It's a simple type with three main parts:
1. Privately stored data
2. Enum of events to create new state
3. Computed queries to read stored data

#### iOS
```swift
struct CoinState {

  // 1. Privately stored data
  private var isHeads: Bool = true
  
  // 2. Enum of events
  enum Event {
    case flipToHeads
    case flipToTails
  }
  // .. to create new state
  static func reduce(state: CoinState, event: Event) -> CoinState {
    switch event {
    case .flipToHeads: return CoinState(isHeads: true)
    case .flipToTails: return CoinState(isHeads: false)
    }
  }
  
  // 3. Computed queries to read stored data
  var coinSide: String {
    return isHead ? "Heads" : "Tails"
  }
}
```

#### Android
```kotlin
data class CoinState {

  // 1. Privately stored data
  
  // 2. Enum of events
  // .. to create new state
  
  // 3. Computed queries to read stored data
}
```

## How do I write states?
There're many ways how you could write them. We can recommend following these steps:
- Draft an interface:
  - List events that could happen
  - List queries to display UI and load data
  - List commands for navigation flow
- Implement the internals:
  - ❌ Write a failing test that sends an event and asserts a query
  - ✅ Add code to state till test passes
  - 🛠 Refactor code so it's nice, but all tests still pass
  - 🔁 Continue writing tests for all events and queries

### What can be an event?
Anything that just happened that state needs to know. Events can be easily understood and listed by non-developers. Most of events come from a few places:
- User interactions
  - `tappedSearch`
  - `tappedResult`
  - `completedEditing`
  - `pulledToRefresh`
- Networking
  - `loadedSearchResults`
  - `loadedMapData`
- Screen updates
  - `becameReadyForRefresh`
  - `becameVisible`
- Global changes
  - `wentOffline`
  - `willEnterBackground`
  - `changedCurrentLocation`

As events are something that just happened we start their names with verbs in past simple tense.

#### iOS
```swift
struct MyCommuteState {
  enum Event {
    case refetched(MyCommuteResponse)
    case wentOffline
    case loggedIn(Bool)
    case activatedTab(Int)
    case tappedFavorite(MyCommuteTrackStopFavorite)
    case tappedFeedback(MyCommuteUseCase, MyCommuteFeedbackRating)
    case completedFeedback(String)
  }
}
```

#### Android
```kotlin
data class MyCommuteState() {
  sealed class Event {
    data class Refetched(val response: MyCommuteResponse) : Event()
    object WentOffline : Event()
    data class LoggedIn(val isLoggedIn: Boolean) : Event()
    data class ActivatedTab(val index: Int) : Event()
    data class TappedFavorite(val favorite: MyCommuteTrackStopFavorite) : Event()
    data class TappedFeedback(val feedback: Feedback) : Event()
    data class CompletedFeedback(val message: String) : Event()
  }
}
```

### What are queries?
Things you want to know about state

### What to store privately?
Information used to answer queries

### What does the reducer do?
Changes privately stored info according to the event

### What about commands?
They're the returned side effects not persisted in state


## How do I write specs?
In a BDD style. For iOS we use [`Quick` and `Nible`](https://github.com/Quick/Quick), for Android [`Spek`](https://github.com/spekframework/spek)
